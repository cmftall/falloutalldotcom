# Feature Specification: Website Internationalization

**Feature Branch**: `001-internationalization`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to make my personal websie international. I want to add the support for the french language and easy to add other langages later.I want the website to auto-use the language of the visitor's browser/system if they are supported language, other wise fallback to english."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Language Detection (Priority: P1)

A visitor from France opens the website and sees all content automatically displayed in French without any manual language selection.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - seamless user experience for French-speaking visitors without any friction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the website with French browser/system locale and verifying all text content appears in French.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor has French as their browser/system language, **When** they visit the website, **Then** all content displays in French
2. **Given** a visitor has French as their browser/system language, **When** they navigate between pages, **Then** all content remains in French consistently
3. **Given** a visitor has French as their browser/system language, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the language preference persists

---

### User Story 2 - Manual Language Selection (Priority: P2)

A visitor wants to manually switch between English and French languages using a language selector.

**Why this priority**: Provides user control and accessibility for users who prefer a different language than their system default.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using a language selector to switch between English and French and verifying content changes immediately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor is viewing the website in English, **When** they click the French language option, **Then** all content immediately switches to French
2. **Given** a visitor is viewing the website in French, **When** they click the English language option, **Then** all content immediately switches to English
3. **Given** a visitor changes the language, **When** they navigate to other pages, **Then** the selected language persists across all pages
4. **Given** a visitor is viewing the website in X language, **When** they click the X language option, **Then** all content immediately switches to X

---

### User Story 3 - Fallback to English (Priority: P2)

A visitor with an unsupported language (not English or French) sees the website in English as the default fallback.

**Why this priority**: Ensures all visitors can access the website content regardless of their language, with English as the universal fallback.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting browser/system language to an unsupported language and verifying content displays in English.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor has German as their browser/system language, **When** they visit the website, **Then** all content displays in English
2. **Given** a visitor has Spanish as their browser/system language, **When** they visit the website, **Then** all content displays in English
3. **Given** a visitor has an unsupported language, **When** they manually select French, **Then** all content switches to French

---

### User Story 4 - Language Persistence (Priority: P3)

A visitor's language preference is remembered across browser sessions and page visits.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience by maintaining their language choice without requiring re-selection.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a language, closing the browser, reopening, and verifying the language preference is maintained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor selects French as their language, **When** they close and reopen the browser, **Then** the website loads in French
2. **Given** a visitor selects English as their language, **When** they navigate between pages, **Then** all pages maintain English
3. **Given** a visitor changes language preference, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the new language preference is maintained

### Edge Cases

- What happens when browser language detection fails or returns invalid data? Fallback to English.
- What happens when translation content is missing for a specific language? Fallback to English.

- What happens when a visitor has no language preference set in their browser? Fallback to English.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: How should the system detect the visitor's language preference? → A: Use browser's `navigator.language` API with fallback to English
- Q: What specific content should be translated? → A: All user-facing text content (navigation, headings, body text, buttons, forms, error messages)

## Assumptions

- French and English are the primary target languages for the personal portfolio
- Browser language detection APIs are reliable and available
- Translation content will be maintained manually by the website owner
- Future language additions will follow the same pattern as French implementation
- Language preference storage uses browser localStorage or similar client-side mechanism
- All website content (static and dynamic) needs translation support
- Language switching should not require page reload for optimal user experience

## Implementation Learnings & Experience

### Key Strategic Insights

**1. Custom i18n vs. Third-Party Libraries**
- **Learning**: Third-party libraries like `next-intl` can introduce complexity and compatibility issues with static exports
- **Experience**: A custom i18n solution, while more initial work, provides better control and reliability for static sites
- **Decision**: Built custom i18n system that's lightweight, maintainable, and works seamlessly with Next.js static export

**2. User Experience Priorities**
- **Learning**: Users expect immediate language switching without page reloads
- **Experience**: Smooth transitions and persistent preferences significantly improve user satisfaction
- **Implementation**: Client-side language switching with localStorage persistence and smooth UI transitions

**3. Content Management Strategy**
- **Learning**: Centralized translation files are easier to maintain than scattered translation keys
- **Experience**: JSON-based translation files with clear hierarchical structure enable efficient content updates
- **Structure**: Organized translations by feature sections (navigation, hero, work, etc.) for better maintainability

**4. Fallback and Error Handling**
- **Learning**: Graceful degradation is crucial for internationalization
- **Experience**: Always fallback to English when translations are missing or language detection fails
- **Implementation**: Robust error handling with English as universal fallback language

**5. Performance Considerations**
- **Learning**: i18n should not impact site performance or loading times
- **Experience**: Lazy loading of translation content and efficient client-side switching maintains fast performance
- **Result**: Zero performance impact while maintaining full i18n functionality

### User Feedback Integration

**1. Content Quality Focus**
- **Learning**: Users are very sensitive to mixed-language content
- **Experience**: Even small amounts of untranslated content significantly impact perceived quality
- **Process**: Systematic content audit and translation verification became critical

**2. Visual Design Considerations**

- **Solution**: Client-side i18n with server-side pre-rendering for optimal performance

**2. Scalability Planning**
- **Learning**: Future language additions should be straightforward
- **Experience**: Well-structured translation files and consistent patterns enable easy expansion
- **Architecture**: Modular translation system that supports unlimited language additions

**3. Development Workflow**
- **Learning**: Translation management requires clear processes and documentation
- **Experience**: Version control for translation files and clear change tracking improves maintenance
- **Process**: Structured approach to translation updates with clear ownership and review processes

### Production Readiness Insights

**1. Quality Assurance**
