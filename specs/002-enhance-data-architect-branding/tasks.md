## Summary

This feature enhances the personal portfolio website to establish professional credibility and authority as a Senior Data Architect through a **credibility-first approach**. Following a comprehensive audit (2025-01-27), the implementation prioritizes removing false claims, fixing privacy issues, and establishing verifiable proof before adding new content.

**Total Tasks**: 110 (77 original + 32 critical fixes + 18 new requirements)  
**User Stories**: 5 (P1: 2, P2: 2, P3: 1) - Scope revised based on credibility audit  
**Critical Priority**: Phase 0 - Credibility Audit Fixes (32 tasks MUST complete before other phases)  
**User-Blocking Tasks**: 3 tasks require user action (T078-T080 testimonials, T081-T082 case studies, T083 cert verification)  
**Parallel Opportunities**: 24 tasks can be executed in parallel  
**MVP Scope**: Phase 0 (Credibility Fixes) + Phase 2.5 (User Content) + User Story 1 (Professional Credibility)

**Critical Path**: Phase 0 → Phase 2.5 (USER blocks here) → Phase 3-7 → Phase 8
