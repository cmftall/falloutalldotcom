## **EMAIL 1: To Your BNC Manager**

**Subject:** Quick favor - testimonial for my professional website?

---

Hi [Manager Name],

I hope you're doing well! I'm updating my professional website and would love to include a testimonial from you about our work together at National Bank.

**What I'm hoping you could speak to** (1-2 sentences is plenty):
- The PySpark QA framework we built and its impact (30% error reduction, â‚¬130K+ savings)
- My leadership of the 7-person data engineering team
- The analytical foundation we delivered (100+ pipelines, bank-wide scope)

**Example format** (feel free to write your own):
> "Fallou transformed our data platform at BNC. His PySpark framework reduced errors by 30% and became our engineering standard across 80+ pipelines. He's one of the best data architects I've worked with - technical depth combined with strong team leadership."

This will be featured on my website alongside my detailed case study about the BNC project.

**Could you send me 2-3 sentences by [Date 2 weeks from now]?** I'd really appreciate it!

Thanks so much,  
Fallou

## **EMAIL 2: To the Engineer Who Replaced You**

**Subject:** Quick request - testimonial about working together at BNC?

---

Hi [Engineer Name],

Hope all is going well leading the data engineering team! I'm building out my professional website and thought you'd be the perfect person to provide a testimonial.

**What I'm hoping you could speak to** (1-2 sentences):
- Your experience taking over as team lead after me
- The PySpark QA framework and how it's helped the team
- Knowledge transfer and mentorship during our time working together

**Example format** (or write your own):
> "When Fallou left BNC, I stepped into his role leading the data engineering team. The PySpark framework he built was so well-designed and documented that it's still our team's foundation today. He didn't just build systems - he built a team that could maintain and evolve them."

This will go on my website showing the sustainability of the work we did together.

**Could you send me 2-3 sentences by [Date 2 weeks from now]?**

Thanks!  
Fallou

**Subject:** Testimonial request - your growth at BNC?

Hi [Team Member Name],

Congratulations again on your promotion - you earned it! I'm updating my professional website and would love a short testimonial from you about our time working together.

**What I'm hoping you could speak to** (1-2 sentences):
- How I mentored/supported your career growth
- Technical skills you learned (PySpark, data architecture, modern tools)
- Any specific moments that helped your development

**Example format** (or write your own):
> "Working with Fallou at BNC was a turning point in my career. He taught me modern data engineering practices - from PySpark to dbt to CI/CD - and mentored me through complex architectural decisions. His approach to both technical excellence and team development directly contributed to my promotion."

This will be featured on my website alongside other testimonials about the BNC work.

**Could you send me 2-3 sentences by [Date 2 weeks from now]?**

Really appreciate it!
