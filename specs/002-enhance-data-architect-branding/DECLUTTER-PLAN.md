# üßπ DECLUTTER & REMOVE REDUNDANCY PLAN

## **IDENTIFIED REDUNDANCIES:**

### **1. CRITICAL: Company Names Shown TWICE** üî¥
**Location:** Hero (bottom) AND WorkedWith (entire section)

**Current:**
- Hero line 224-228: "Trusted by: National Bank of Canada, Orange, Sopra Steria"
- WorkedWith section: Same companies with logos

**Fix:** Remove company tags from Hero bottom (keep WorkedWith section)

**Reason:** WorkedWith has gold "Trusted By" treatment with logos - much better than text pills

---

### **2. REDUNDANT: Metrics Descriptions** üü°
**Location:** Hero metrics have 2 lines of text each

**Current:**
```
‚Ç¨130K+
Annual Savings
"Achieved through data quality"  ‚Üê Extra line
```

**Fix:** Remove third line description (keep number + label only)

**Reason:** Cleaner, less text, impact still clear

---

### **3. REDUNDANT: WorkedWith Subtitle** üü°
**Location:** WorkedWith section

**Current:** "Delivering ‚Ç¨130K+ savings and measurable ROI across enterprise organizations"

**Fix:** Remove or shorten to "Proven results across enterprise organizations"

**Reason:** ‚Ç¨130K+ already prominent in Hero, don't repeat exact number

---

### **4. TOO MANY CTAs** üü°
**Current:**
- Hero: 2 CTAs (View Case Studies + Book Call)
- Contact: 1 CTA (Book Call)

**Fix:** Keep both Hero CTAs, they serve different purposes

**Reason:** "View Case Studies" = low commitment, "Book Call" = high commitment - both needed

---

### **5. CREDENTIAL BADGE TEXT** üü°
**Location:** Hero top

**Current:** Full address "Data Architect ‚Ä¢ Paris, France & Montreal, Canada"

**Fix:** Shorten to "Paris & Montreal ‚Ä¢ Available for Consulting"

**Reason:** Location is in Contact section already, emphasize availability instead

---

### **6. TESTIMONIALS SECTION** üü¢
**Current:** Full transparency explanation box

**Keep:** It's unique and valuable, don't remove

**Reason:** Radical transparency is a differentiator

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:**

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Do Now):**
1. ‚úÖ Remove company tags from Hero bottom
2. ‚úÖ Simplify Hero metrics (remove third line)
3. ‚úÖ Shorten WorkedWith subtitle
4. ‚úÖ Simplify credential badge

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Optional):**
5. ‚ö™ Check if Expertise section needs simplification
6. ‚ö™ Review Contact services list (might be too much)

### **LOW PRIORITY (Keep as is):**
- Testimonials transparency (unique value)
- Certifications (already minimal)
- Contact section layout (works well)

- Redundant info: 3 instances

**After Cleanup:**
- Hero: 5 elements (remove company tags)
- Page length: 95%
- Redundant info: 0 instances

**Result:** Cleaner, more focused, premium feel maintained
