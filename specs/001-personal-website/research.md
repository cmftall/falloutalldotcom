## Content Authenticity Strategy

**Decision**: Replace all fake content with real CV-based content and remove non-existent blog posts

**Rationale**: Professional credibility requires authentic content. Fake blog posts with fabricated metrics destroy trust and professional reputation. In the data architecture field, authenticity and technical accuracy are paramount for client trust and business development.

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Adding disclaimers to fake content (rejected - still appears deceptive and unprofessional)
- Creating real blog posts before launch (rejected - time constraints and content quality concerns)

**Implementation**: Remove all fabricated blog posts, metrics, and engagement numbers. Replace with authentic project highlights and technical achievements from CV.

## Project Case Study Detail Level

**Decision**: Include specific technologies, quantified metrics, and anonymized client details

**Rationale**: Technical stakeholders need concrete evidence of expertise and impact. Generic descriptions don't differentiate from competitors and fail to demonstrate the depth of technical knowledge required for senior data architecture roles.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Generic descriptions for privacy (rejected - lacks credibility and specificity)
- Detailed client names (rejected - confidentiality concerns and professional ethics)

**Implementation**: Enhance project descriptions with specific technologies used, quantified business impact, anonymized client context, and technical architecture decisions.

## Design Complexity Level

**Decision**: Simplify design to focus on content readability and professional credibility

**Rationale**: Over-animated designs distract from content and can appear unprofessional. Clean, readable design builds trust and allows technical content to be the primary focus. Data architects value clarity and precision over flashy effects.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Rich animations and effects (rejected - distracts from content and appears unprofessional)
- More interactive elements (rejected - performance impact and accessibility concerns)

**Implementation**: Reduce animation complexity, focus on subtle transitions, improve typography hierarchy, and ensure content is easily scannable.

## Social Proof Strategy

**Decision**: No testimonials available, focus on project achievements and technical credibility

**Rationale**: Authentic testimonials unavailable due to client confidentiality and time constraints. Technical achievements and quantified results provide stronger credibility than generic testimonials in the data architecture field.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Adding fake testimonials (rejected - unethical and damaging to professional reputation)
- Requesting testimonials from clients (rejected - time constraints and confidentiality concerns)

**Implementation**: Emphasize technical achievements, quantified project outcomes, and professional certifications as credibility signals.

## Content Priority Strategy

**Decision**: Focus on detailed project case studies and technical achievements over blog content

**Rationale**: Portfolio-driven approach aligns with data architecture field expectations. Technical achievements demonstrate expertise better than generic blog posts. Senior data architects are evaluated on project complexity and business impact.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Creating real blog posts before launch (rejected - time constraints and content quality concerns)
- Removing insights section entirely (rejected - reduces content depth and thought leadership opportunity)

**Implementation**: Transform insights section to showcase technical achievements, project highlights, and expertise areas rather than blog posts.
