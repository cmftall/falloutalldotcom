## Core Principles

### I. Modern Personal Brand
<!-- Personal website foundation -->
Showcase data architecture expertise and enterprise modernization experience; Clean, professional design that reflects technical leadership; Interactive elements that demonstrate cloud-native and data platform knowledge; Portfolio-driven content structure

### II. Performance & Scalability
<!-- Web performance standards -->
Core Web Vitals compliance mandatory; Fast loading times to reflect data architecture expertise; Optimized images and assets; Lazy loading for portfolio content; CDN distribution for global reach; Mobile-first responsive design

### III. Accessibility & Inclusivity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
<!-- WCAG compliance standards -->
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory; Inclusive design reflecting enterprise diversity values; Semantic HTML for screen readers; Keyboard navigation support; High contrast mode support; Alt text for all visual content

Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) last 2 versions; Cross-platform compatibility reflecting cloud-native expertise; Progressive enhancement approach; Mobile-first responsive design; Error handling and graceful degradation

### V. Clean Architecture & Maintainability
<!-- Code quality standards -->
Modern web technologies (React/Next.js or Vue/Nuxt for interactivity); Well-structured, documented codebase; Component-based architecture; TypeScript for type safety; Git workflow with conventional commits; Automated testing and deployment

## Technology Stack & Standards
<!-- Modern personal website technologies -->

**Core Technologies**: Next.js 14+ (React) or Nuxt 3+ (Vue), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
**Data Visualization**: D3.js, Chart.js, or Observable Plot for data architecture demos
**Cloud Integration**: AWS SDK, Azure SDK for portfolio demonstrations
**Build Tools**: Vite, Webpack, or Next.js built-in bundling
**Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify with CI/CD
**Performance**: Lighthouse score >95, Core Web Vitals in green
**Security**: HTTPS only, CSP headers, environment variable management
**Analytics**: Privacy-focused analytics (Plausible, Fathom, or self-hosted)

## Development Workflow
<!-- Personal website development process -->

**Branch Strategy**: Feature branches from main; Personal review process with automated checks
**Content Strategy**: Regular blog posts on data architecture topics; Portfolio case studies; Technical demos and tutorials
**Testing**: Component testing with Jest/Testing Library; Visual regression testing; Performance monitoring
**Deployment**: Automated deployment on main branch; Preview deployments for content review
**Quality Gates**: Lighthouse CI, accessibility audits, SEO optimization, mobile responsiveness
**Content Management**: MDX for blog posts; Portfolio data in structured format; Image optimization pipeline

## Governance
<!-- Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

**Compliance Requirements**: All PRs must verify accessibility, performance, and cross-browser compatibility; Breaking changes require migration plan and approval; Framework additions must be justified with clear benefits
**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require team review and approval; Breaking changes need 2-week notice period; Emergency fixes exempt with post-approval documentation
**Quality Enforcement**: Automated checks must pass before merge; Manual review required for accessibility and performance; Regular audits of compliance metrics
